Description: A semi-parametric, multidimensional Bayesian factor analysis for multimodal data.
             By combining a beta-process prior (Knowles and Ghahramani 2011) on the factor loadings matrix
             and treating the observed margins as arbitrary manifestations of a latent Gaussian copula (Murray et al. 2013),
             this package allows the user to perform a factor analysis on data with any
             combination of marginal distributions (continuous, discrete, or both)
             without first specifying the dimensionality (K) of the data. The
             non-parametric prior automatically learns the true dimensionality.
             Potential applications include traditionaldimension reduction, multidimensional
             scaling (item-response theory), and missing data imputation. The sampler is
             implemented in C++ for improved speed and includes post-processing functions
             that are amenable to a tidy workflow.
